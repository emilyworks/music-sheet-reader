# AI Music Sheet Reader
We aim to leverage computer vision techniques to create music visual aids for piano players. At inference time, the input is a sheet music document and the output is a generated video (or series of images) demonstrating how to play the sheet music. An example of a similar output can be found at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeEmGvm7kDk

The motivation behind this project is to address challenges faced by musicians at all levels in reading sheet music. By automating the process of sheet music recognition and offering visual aids, the project aims to make learning music more accessible to those who have not received classical training and/or are unable to read sheet music. Furthermore, the initial interest in the topic of the project stems from all three group members having played instruments and struggled with reading sheet music.
